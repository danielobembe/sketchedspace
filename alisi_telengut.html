                    <p class="eng">
                      Here, there, and everywhere. Spending most of her childhood as a nomad, roaming the Mongolian territory with her grandparents, Alisi’s artistic vision of the world has been shaped by the most authentic of cultural environments. As this lifestyle evolves and slowly disappears, along with its rich ideological and cultural content, Alisi looks towards art to record and convey the stories and experiences reminding to this essential way of life. After leaving Mongolia to complete a Master of Fine Arts in Montreal, Alisi’s spectrum of cultural awareness has been continuing growing.

                    <p class="eng">
                      Life and art are two sides of the same coin, they achieve a symbiosis: “My experiences and personality influence and shapes my art practice” just as “ the research and the creation processes proper to my art are the roots on which my every day-life is built on”. Influenced by the artistic appetite present in her family,  Alisi always wanted to be a painter. However, by chance, she began her first formal artistic training in film animation at a cinema school, and progressively became influenced by influential creative personalities like the film- directors Yuri Norstein (also as Yuriy Norshteyn) and Norman McLaren and the painter Oscar Claude Monet. Here, she begun mastering what will become her preferred medium of expression: animation.

                    <p class="eng">
                      Alisi’s inspiration comes from muses, yet her artistic vision stems from one core belief: “Nature creates the best artwork”. Culture is shaped by nature and natural beauty is nothing without the individual’s perception of it. It is the simplest of images that she has the power of being the most beautiful: “I have been always fascinated by the colors and lights through trees changing with the sunlight. I always wanted to capture these stunning moments that had imprinted in my brain.” In her time based art practice, the straight ahead under the camera of painting  animation has allowed her to mimic these moments and give them new meanings. This process is representative of her artistic methodology, that through dynamic movements generates visual poetry, lyrical representations of memory and a wholly experimental approach to ethnography.

                    <p class="eng">
                      Alisi is currently based in Montreal and her films received awards at the 24th Stockholm International Film Festival, the 36th and the 37th Montreal World Film Festival and Canada International Film Festival. In addition to being screened at TIFF, Cannes (Talent tout court program), Slamdance, Florida, Edinburgh, ZINEBI, and various worldwide film venues and exhibitions as animation and moving image artworks, these films have also contributed to enthnographic, ethnocultural and archaeological research archives.
